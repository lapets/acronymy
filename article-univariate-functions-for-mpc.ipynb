Some MPC protocols (such as additive secret sharing and [Shamir's secret sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing) schemes) rely on secret sharing operations that are homormophic with respect to addition. Thus, such protocols enable (1) addition of two secret-shared values and (2) multiplication of a secret-shared value by an in-the-clear (*i.e.*, known to all parties) scalar value.
